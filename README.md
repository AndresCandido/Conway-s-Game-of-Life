# Conway's Game of Life

The Game of Life - made with Python<br>
By: Andres Candido

The Game of Life is a simulation of cellular evolution, played on a 2-D grid of cells, where each cell can be in one of two states: alive or dead.

The game proceeds in steps, or generations. At each step, the following rules are applied simultaneously to every cell:

1. Survival: A live cell with two or three live neighbors survives to the next generation.
2. Death: A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies from underpopulation, or with more than three live neighbors dies from overpopulation.
3. Birth: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive in the next generation.
